# 🍲 Sainne's Health And Hunger
A minecraft datapack that changes food and regeneration mechanics. Making the game more difficult.
## ✔️ Features
* Natural Regeneration no longer works, meaning saturation does not heal directly.
* Having your hunger bar over 16 regenerates your health at a speed of 1HP/5sec
* Having your hunger between 16 and 6 regenerates your health at a speed of 1HP/10sec
* Receiving damage interrupts natural healing for 15 seconds.
* Eating raw food gives the hunger and nausea effects.
* However to compensate certain foods have different short potion effects.
